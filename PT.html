        Professor P,a,t,r,i,c,k T,a,y,l,o,r, (PT, so that this is less likely to appear in Google searches that he might have software running).<br>
        It is dangerous for me to post this, but unlike PT, I believe in openness of information.  PT is a cancerous hacker who is now "teaching" more students than anyone else in the Computer Science department.  He took over Data Structures for a time, and forcefully installed not one, but two new required classes that have only been taught by him (Intro to Computer Security, and a new intro class that is to go before CS1570).  No other instructor has made changes of any significance compared to him, and his changes are forceful, but undocumented, as his new class is not mentioned anywhere online.  Unlike Dr. Markowsky, who tried to fail every student but was forced to pass some, PT always gets what he wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate how much of a computer/security freak he is, he likes to use the Dvorak keyboard layout.  He runs Qubes, which uses the Xen hypervisor, on his laptop, so that each application runs in its own VM.  He prides himself in his ninjaness in computers, and laughs at his students for having problems with software "tools" that he specifically chooses because they are hard to use.

        When you must take his security class, make lots of friends.  They will teach you what you need to know.  A typical assignment in security class is due over 5 to 10 days, and is about 30 hours of trying to learn how to hack via Google searches.  There are only assignments available half the time, since the class would be a lot more passable if the assignments were due over longer periods.

        See ratemyprofessor.com for lots more information on PT, including a record of how he changed students' grades to 0's after finals week was over.

      Written by me in FS2018:
      <p>
        This semester (FS2018) I enrolled in 18 credit hours, including Intro to Computer Security.
        I also took a 16 hours per week web development job for the first time.
        This was more than any semester in the past.
        The first five weeks got progressively more intense.
        At the weekend after week 5, I had an assignment in every class due the next week and one test.
        This included a security assignment which I had worked on and deemed impossible.
        <br>
        The first security homework was graded and the grades were posted on a Wednesday.
        Naturally, I got a 0.
        So the first thing [PT] said in class was, "If you got a zero, it is because you forgot something like a shebang or an import or to change the permissions of your file.  It always gets me how 25% of students never run the command I give them to test their code.  You have 1 week to resubmit for a 70% regrade."
        I was mad because my program worked and I didn't know what to do to fix it.
        So I went to the grader's office hours and he showed me the error he had (which was not given to me otherwise).
        It was something like IOError: unable to open file "Dictionary.txt".
        He said the error was probably on his side, not mine, which was inconsistent with what [PT] had said in class.
        Two days later he regraded my assignment and I got 100.
        Shortly afterward, I was working on assignment 3.
        It was about gpg.
        Note that gpg was never mentioned in class.
        I went all out, repeatedly posting on the provided Canvas forum.
        But I could not get 5 people to cooperate, as the assignment required.
        It wasn't until I had already gotten my advisor's signature that I was finally added to the GroupMe.
        Many professors do not know what GroupMe is.
        It is an app that allows students to communicate with other students without the professor knowing, and it is necessary when the quality of instruction is poor.
        All the answers were posted there, but it was too late for me.
        I dropped security.
        <br>
        But after I dropped security, the semester got progressively less intense.
        The next week, I only had assignments in 2 classes and no test.
        The next week I had no assignments at all and no test.
        I need to take an average of 19 credit hours for the next two semesters to graduate December 2019.
        Many students have done this in the past, and surely I can.
        <br>
        Therefore, I would like to put in print that I resolve not to drop classes, no matter how impossible they may seem.
        The only time I should drop a class is if I know for sure that I cannot pass.
