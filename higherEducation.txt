I would like to challenge a common view on higher education.  Many people hold degrees as a sign of skill and endurance.  They point out how long these people were able to endure school.  Doctors hold themselves higher than the lesser people in society (mostly students) to generate respect for themselves.
I claim that higher degrees restrict skill development.  Last summer, I met people who were far more skilled than anyone I knew existed before.  I had an internship at IntelliFarms.  At IntelliFarms, they control their computers to levels most professors believe do not exist.  For example, rather than using a point-and-click window manager, they use I3, a keystroke-based window manager.  They do this to minimize the number of times they move their hand to the mouse.  They set up keybindings for basic syntax elements.  By continually building tools, their productivity increases exponentially, the way technology does.
At the university, you will spend your time serving those who are higher on the academic ladder, whether that be writing code to match their grader, trying to think like them for their quizzes, or completing countless hours of activities designed to offend the students to the point of suicide. 
I have had a lot of professors, and only one was as skilled with computers as the average IntelliFarms developer, and this professor was a very malicious person (I would definitely not hire this professor).
Two fun years at IntelliFarms builds a lot more skills than 4-8 excruciating years at Missouri S&T, but the latter gives a lot more value in society.
