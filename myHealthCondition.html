      <h1>My Health Condition</h1>
      <p>I have a health problem characterized by pain in my forehead every hour of every day.  I also get migraine attacks a few times a week.  The migraine attacks started gradually around 2018, and the persistent head pain started more recently.  Here are some treatments I have tried: magnesium, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, Nurtec (rimegepant), propranolol, Emgality (galcanezumab), topiramate.  I am currently (2021-09-06) writing down my health experiences in a Google sheet, including almost everything I eat, multiple numbers describing my condition, lots of text, and all medication I take.  I have written python programs that analyze this data.</p>
      <p>Here are some findings:</p>
      <p>
        <h2>Attack Frequency by Day of Week</h2>
        I have been much more likely to have migraine attacks on Sundays than other days of the week.  The strength of this has varied from semester to semester.  Here I present my findings by 4-month periods:
        <ul>
        <li>2019-09-01 to 2019-12-31:  p=0.002;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-01-01 to 2020-04-30:  p=0.5;  I was not more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-05-01 to 2020-08-31:  p=0.5;  I was not more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-09-01 to 2020-12-31:  p=0.02;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period, but not as much as during some of the other periods.</li>
        <li>2021-01-01 to 2021-04-30:  p=0.005;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2021-05-01 to 2021-08-31:  p=0.0001;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        </ul>
        Here is a graph of the day-of-week trends:

        <br />
        I do not know what causes these trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Propranolol</h2>
        Propranolol is one of the many medications I have been prescribed.  As a nonselective beta blocker, propranolol's primary action is reducing pulse <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/propranolol.html">[1]</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIwCEydWgr8">[2]</a>.  To measure my pulse, I have been using a mobile app called <a href="https://appadvice.com/app/stresscam-check-your-stress-pulse-and-bio-age/1181118630">StressCam</a>.  This app is old, so its website, stress-cam.com, has been taken down.  It only works on my older iPhone and not my newer one.
        <br />
        The following image shows that propranolol lowered my pulse.  The dosage of propranolol varied.

      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Foods</h2>
        I have also found that what I eat has little effect on my health other than making me vomit sometimes.  Some foods have statistically significant correlations:
        <ul>
          <li>I tend to not eat apples on Saturdays (p=0.003).  Since I tend to have attacks on Sundays, this caused a correlation between apples and attacks that led me to investigate apples as a dietary treatment for my condition.  But when I did day-of-week analysis, I found that this was caused by a day-of-week trend.</li>
          <li>The day before I eat potatoes, I tend to have less head pain. (p=0.005).  Potatoes do not have any day-of-week correlation.</li>
        </ul>
        If nutrition made a difference, I would expect many correlations that I do not see.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Amitriptyline</h2>
        This is the only medication that I know caused side effects.  To anyone taking this medication here is my warning: the withdrawal was 100 times as severe as starting the medication.  It is far more difficult to stop this medication than start it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        I have a history of believing a treatment works for my migraine headaches but deciding it does not work months later.  I followed this pattern with magnesium, sumatriptan, Nurtec, propranolol, and topiramate.  Currently, I do not know that any treatments have helped my condition.  Now that I have followed this pattern multiple times, I am very skeptical when someone says a treatment helped their chronic condition.
