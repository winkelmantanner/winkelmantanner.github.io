      <h1>My Health Condition</h1>
      <p>I have a health problem characterized by pain in my forehead every hour of every day.  I also get migraine attacks a few times a week.  The migraine attacks started gradually around 2018, and the persistent head pain started more recently.  Here are some treatments I have tried: magnesium, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10, Nurtec (rimegepant), propranolol, Emgality (galcanezumab), topiramate.  I am currently (2021-09-06) writing down my health experiences in a Google sheet, including almost everything I eat, multiple numbers describing my condition, lots of text, and all medication I take.  I have written python programs that analyze this data.</p>
      <p>Here are some findings:</p>
      <p>
        <h2>Attack Frequency by Day of Week</h2>
        I have been much more likely to have migraine attacks on Sundays than other days of the week.  The strength of this has varied from semester to semester.  Here I present my findings by 4-month periods:
        <ul>
        <li>2019-09-01 to 2019-12-31:  p=0.002;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-01-01 to 2020-04-30:  p=0.5;  I was not more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-05-01 to 2020-08-31:  p=0.5;  I was not more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2020-09-01 to 2020-12-31:  p=0.02;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period, but not as much as during some of the other periods.</li>
        <li>2021-01-01 to 2021-04-30:  p=0.005;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        <li>2021-05-01 to 2021-08-31:  p=0.0001;  I was more likely to have attacks on Sundays during this period.</li>
        </ul>
        Here is a graph of the day-of-week trends:

        <br />
        I do not know what causes these trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Propranolol</h2>
        Propranolol is one of the many medications I have been prescribed.  As a nonselective beta blocker, propranolol's primary action is reducing pulse <a href="https://www.drugs.com/monograph/propranolol.html">[1]</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIwCEydWgr8">[2]</a>.  To measure my pulse, I have been using a mobile app called <a href="https://appadvice.com/app/stresscam-check-your-stress-pulse-and-bio-age/1181118630">StressCam</a>.  This app is old, so its website, stress-cam.com, has been taken down.  It only works on my older iPhone and not my newer one.
        <br />
        The following image shows that propranolol lowered my pulse.  The dosage of propranolol varied.
        <br />
        <img src="heartRateAndPropranolol.png" height="500px" style="border: 2px solid rgb(127,127,127)" title="heart rate graph" alt="heart rate graph" />
        <br />
        Propranolol did not correlate significantly with any metric of my headache condition.  So I know it affected me, but it did not benefit me.  So I am unlikely to try it any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Amitriptyline</h2>
        To anyone taking amitriptyline here is my warning: the withdrawal was 100 times as severe as starting the medication.  It is far more difficult to stop this medication than start it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Escitalpram (Lexapro)</h2>
        I asked my doctor for this medication, and they prescribed it.  Escitalpram is a safer antidepressant than amitriptyline.  I usually took one 10mg pill before going to bed in the evening.
        <br />
        Here is what I know about escitralopram's effects on me:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Escitalpram causes insomnia.</strong>  I thought escitralopram was not affecting me until I looked at the output from one of my python programs called <i>offset_spearman.py</i>.  This program uses <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html">scipy.stats.spearmanr</a> to get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Spearman">Spearman correlation coefficient and p-value</a> between numerous pairs of attributes with one attribute shifted by a number of days called the offset.  The program tries offset values -1, 0, 1, and 2.  I have been recording an integer called sleepdifficulty every day.  Between 2021-07-01 and 2021-10-01, the spearman correlation coefficient between escitalopram in the evening and sleepdifficulty on that night was <strong>0.38</strong>, with p-value <strong>0.0002</strong>.
            <br />
            <strong>Technical note:</strong> This python program treats the days as non-sequential, but days are sequential.  So I must consider the sequentiality of the data as a possible cause of significant p-values (it has been the cause in some analyses I have done).  Here is some evidence against sequentiality being the cause here:
            <ul>
              <li>
                With this date range, sleepdifficulty does not correlate with itself with offset=1 (from one day to the next).
              </li>
              <li>
                None of the other day offsets had a significant p-value.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Escitalpram causes nausea.</strong>  For this, I searched my records for the words "nausea" and "vomit" (I often wrote that I "feel like vomiting").  I created a column of integers based on my text records.  Between 2021-07-01 and 2021-10-01, the spearman correlation coefficient between taking escitalopram in the evening and nausea the next day was <strong>0.35</strong>, with p-value <strong>0.0006</strong>.  None of the other day offsets have a significant p-value.</li>
        </ul>
        The following graph shows the data used for these findings.  Escitalopram and sleepdifficulty are counted on the day following the event.

        <br />
        Escitalopram did not correlate significantly with any metric of my headache condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Topiramate</h2>
        Topiramate was brought up in late 2019 when my first neurologist said they would prescribe amitriptyline instead because topiramate had been shown to increase the rate of suicidality and I had a psychiatric history.  This does not make sense because amitriptyline is far more dangerous than topiramate.  In April 2021 I asked my current neurologist for topiramate and they prescribed it.  I have been trying topiramate since then and it is November 2021 when I am writing this.  So far I do not know of any effect whatsoever.  I am currently working on increasing the dosage to 100mg per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Foods</h2>
        Every day I record a list of foods I eat.  I use a python program to analyze this data.  As of 2021-10-02, there are no noteworthy correlations between the troublesomeness of my condition and any of more than 50 foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        I have a history of believing a treatment works for my migraine headaches but deciding it does not work months later.  I followed this pattern with magnesium, sumatriptan, Nurtec, propranolol, and topiramate.  Currently, I do not know that any treatments have helped my condition.  Now that I have followed this pattern multiple times, I am very skeptical when someone says a treatment helped their chronic condition.
