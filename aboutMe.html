      <p>In May 2021 I graduated from Missouri University of Science and Technology, the university in Rolla, Missouri.  I now have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  One of the purposes of this page is to publicly provide evidence of my graduation.  My GPA was 3.977/4.0.  When I was at the university, I performed very well on tests, but I could not handle heavy workloads.  In my last semester I took the <a href="https://testcenter.mst.edu/testingprograms/majorfieldtest/">Major Field Test</a>, which is required for Computer Science seniors.  I was able to see my results afterward, and here is what I saw:</p>

      <p>99th percentile is the interesting information there.</p>
      <p>On June 19, 2021, my diploma arrived in the mail along with official transcripts.  Here is my diploma:</p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <p>Immediately after graduating, I started a job as a software developer.  I currently do not want to publicly post the details of the job (September 2021).</p>
