      <p>I was working on a reading summary on Peter Singer's <i>Famine, Affluence, Morality</i> for Philos 3235 (Business Ethics)
      when I got into a discussion with myself on some of his other philosophies, such as his adherence to the idea that the existence of evil disproves the Bible's claims of God's omnipotence and God's love for the people in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
      The purpose of human existence is to honor to God, and the honor God gains from the few who choose to accept him outweighs the honor God loses from the many who reject him.  The existence of both options and our free will to choose between them is necessary to bring maximum honor to God.
      </p>

      Then if God can do anything, does God really love us?  I came to the conclusion that God only loves people that accept his love.  This means most people in the world live without God's love, since most people do not accept God (Mattew 7:13).  And without God's love, each of those who reject God will experience eternal suffering after his or her body dies.  Even those who accept God's love may experience suffering in the world, but the reward they will receive for their continued adherence to God through suffering will far outweigh the suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
      Then if God only loves some people, why does Jesus tell us to love all people (as in Mark 12:31)?  As humans, we are not authorized to judge people.  We cannot tell whether or not one of our neighbors has a good relationship with God.  Therefore, Jesus instructs his followers to love all of their neighbors.  Also, by loving their neighbors, they may bring their neighbors into good relationships with God.
