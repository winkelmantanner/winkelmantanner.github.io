      I was working on a reading summary on Peter Singer's <i>Famine, Affluence, Morality</i> for Philos 3235
      when I got into a discussion with myself on some of his other philosophies, such as his adherence to the idea that the existence of evil disproves the Bible's claims that God exists and that God loves the people in the world.  
      <br>
      Our purpose for existence is to bring honor to God, and the honor God gets from the few who choose to accept him outweighs the honor he loses from the many who reject him.  Life is a test to see whether or not we will choose God or Satan.  The existence of both options and our free will to choose between them is necessary to bring maximum honor to God.  Then if God can do anything, does God really love us?  I came to the conclusion that God only loves people that accept his love.  This means most people in the world live without his love.  And without his love, each of those who reject God will experience eternal suffering after his or her body dies.  Even those who accept God's love may experience suffering in the world, but the reward they will receive for their continued adherence to God through suffering will far outweigh the suffering.
      If God only loves some people, why does Jesus tell us to love all people (as in Mark 12:31)?  As humans, we are not authorized to judge people.  In fact, we cannot tell whether or not one of our neighbors has a good relationship with God.  Therefore, we are instructed to love all of our neighbors.  Also, by loving our neighbor, we may bring them to a good relationship with God.
