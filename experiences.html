      <h4>Education</h4>
      I am a full-time student at Missouri S&amp;T during the semesters.  My major is Computer Science.  I will probably graduate May 2020, or possibly December 2019.  As of winter 2018/2019, my GPA is about 3.97.  This is because

        <li>
          I am a perfectionist and it pains me to lose points.
        </li>
        <li>
          I have some kind of brain defect that makes me unusually good at <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B77Lj3xEvpg7bmlyZTM0WjE4REk'>math</a> and <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yC8snWEJ2jUuwEhaZABpR8XF3yDqiIXC'>physics (especially physics)</a>.  My mother calls it Asperger's Syndrome.

      </ol>
      I was almost entirely homeschooled until I enrolled at the university.
      <h4>Employment</h4>

          <h4 class='tanner-bullet-header'>IntelliFarms, Summer 2018</h4>
          <p>
            The top experience on my resume is my internship at IntelliFarms.  I definitely learned more during this four months than any other four months of my life (with the exception of when I was an infant).  This was also an enjoyable occupation for me.  After working at IntelliFarms, it seems that the other places I have taken development jobs seek only to keep their employment going, rather than complete a task such as permanently fixing bugs or completing features.  At IntelliFarms, the work is driven by the need for functional software.  This makes the software have a lot of features, such as maps, front-end filtering of data, and even fancy SVG images representing the quality of grain in grain bins.  Over the course of the summer, the team I was on, which consisted of about 50% newbies and 50% experts, put these features and more into one application, which was deployed to production at the end of the internship.

          <p>
            This was a full-time internship lasting about one month, during the Christmas break of 2017/2018.  I spent the first half of this internship completing training challenges in Java.  Then, I spent the second half searching for bugs in a Java code base.  The code base deployment process is difficult to get working (it takes several hours to set up) so they didn't bother setting it up on my workstation.  So the most powerful tool I had was Eclipse's equivalent of grep.  I made less than 15 lines of code that made it to production during this internship.  This was my first development job and it helped prepare me for my more serious internship at IntelliFarms, but I did not learn things as quickly as I do on my own and consequently I did not enjoy the work I was doing.

          <p>
            This is a remote, usually part-time job in which Lucas and I work with a friend from S&amp;T, who we met through the Christian Campus Fellowship.  He has extremely strict coding standards that make it difficult for us to make code quickly.  He requires us to overload Django defaults for every entity set in his large ER diagram (it has over 30 entity sets).  Then, he requires us to write thorough, programmatic tests for all the "production" code we write: more than twice as many lines of tests as lines of production code.   So we literally copy-paste both production and test code from previous entities and change it to match the entity under development.  This is tedious, slow-going work, and I learn things more slowly in this job than at the State of Missouri, although this job pays well.  Our application consists of massive numbers of forms and nothing else.

          <p>
            I didn't make any money from this, but the COER resume reviewers said this should be given the title "Self Employed."  Right before I began school at the university, I developed my own iOS apps.  The best app that I made is
