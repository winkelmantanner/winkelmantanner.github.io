1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://git-classes.mst.edu/2018-FS-CS3100/T12.git`
2. Make a copy of the DumbAI.java file and rename your copy to something like <your name>AI.java
3. Open the new file you just made and change the name of the class to match the name of the file. Also change the name constant to whatever you want your AI to be listed as.
4. Open Main.java and add your AI to the AI_LIST constant. Make sure that the code compiles and your AI appears in the dropdown before proceeding to the next step.
5. Customize your new AI. Preferably make your AI beat random moves at least 90% of the time. You will need to call public member functions of the passed board and the passed inventory. You may have to look at their files to see what these functions are. Note that non-primitive types are assigned and passed by reference in Java, so if you want a board that you can drop pieces in, you will have to explicitly call the copy constructor with “new Board(old_board)” (similar with Inventory). If you return an invalid move, my code will detect that it is invalid and will make a random valid move instead. My code will also output a message saying why your move was invalid. DumbAI does make invalid moves, but the default AI (random valid moves) does not make invalid moves.
6. Upload your file to Google Drive and share it with me. Then, if you have your work saved where Git can’t reach it and you are feeling brave, you may try to commit and push to your own branch. Otherwise I will put your file into Git.
