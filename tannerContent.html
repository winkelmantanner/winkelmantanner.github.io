      <h3>Tanner Winkelman</h3>
      <p>
        This semester (FS2018) I enrolled in 18 credit hours, including Intro to Computer Security.
        I also took a 16 hours per week web development job for the first time.
        This was more than any semester in the past.
        The first five weeks got progressively more intense.
        At the weekend after week 5, I had an assignment in every class due the next week and one test.
        This included a security assignment which I had worked on and deemed impossible.
        I decided to drop security, since at this rate I would soon be dead.
        But after I dropped security, the semester got progressively less intense.
        The next week, I only had assignments in 2 classes and no test.
        The next week I had no assignments at all and no test.
        I need to take an average of 19 credit hours for the next two semesters to graduate December 2019.
        Many students have done this in the past, and surely I can.
        <br>
        Therefore, I would like to put in print that I resolve not to drop classes, no matter how impossible they may seem.
        The only time I should drop a class is if I know for sure that I cannot pass.
